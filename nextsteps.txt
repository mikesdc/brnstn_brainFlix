useParams to be placed in App.js
    this will listen to the URL changing


In next videos component, map through the array and create a set of Link tags. 
These tags will generate links that include the videoId.
When a link is clicked, the URL updates to include the videoId

When the URL updates, useParams in App.js "listens" for the change and updates.

useEffect can be used to run code when the useParams object is updated (via useEffect dependencies).
The useEffect hook can be used at this point to fetch the selected video data.

Update state with this new data. Page reloads.
